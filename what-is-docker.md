# What is Docker?

Setting up and configuring a computing environment is difficult and often overlooked or implicit. Docker makes it much easier to document and share computing environments by making them portable, atomic units. Docker is kind of difficult to understand  if you are just getting started with [the command line](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html) or even if you have loads of experience managing Linux computers. It takes a bit of time to unravel and reconfigure one's understanding in light of the new paradigm of managing servers that Docker affords. You will need to unlearn and relearn many well heeled practices, which means people starting from the beginning might have a bit of an advantage because they coming to understand this new way managing and administering things without as much baggage. This is not to say you won't have a long and difficult climb, it just means you won't have as heavy of a load to bare.

Docker is best understood to be a suite of technologies that have been designed to make the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining applications . Notice the distinction between _application_ and _server._ This is a subtle but significant shift in emphasis because it signals the paradigm shift that as occurred. Docker shifts focus away from managing and maintaining servers to the management and maintenance of applictions \(and their concomitant environment\). This shift is kind of like what the Ford automobile company says when they talk about [transitioning from a car company to a "mobility" company](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-says-it-will-focus-more-on-transportation-services-sector-1452016172), they are still doing the same basic thing, but instead of building a car to sell you, they are managing a rideshare of self-driving cars \(that you pay to get you from point A to point B\). {NOTE: Perhaps, this analogy is a bit awkward...} The general point of this paragraph is to convey the idea that Docker flips the emphasis from server to service. With Docker you are going to be the manager and operator of a service \(or collection of services\).

To answer the question, "what is Docker" it is common to start with "it is kind of like a virtual machine." Docker is kind of like a virtual machine, it lets you run an isolated computing environment inside of another computing environment. This isolated environment has its own operating system, file system, and networking. However, while Docker does in some superficial ways resemble a virtual machine, however, under the hood it looks very different.

Docker uses a particular technology called _**containerization**_ to isolate environments. Containerization is different from virtualization in that it does not emulate the hardware, but emulates the operating system. In practice this means containers are much more lightweight than virtual machines. Docker is fast. Unlike virtualization, it doesn't have to "boot up" the isolated environment; it runs almost as fast as if you weren't running a thing inside a container \(there is some performance penalty, but that is getting into the nitty-gritty\). Docker is able to be super fast because they share a lot of resources with the host operating system that is running Docker. This does has some important drawbacks and limitations compared to virtualization. Unlike a virtualization solution like VMWare or VirtualBox, you can't really run docker on non-Linux machines AND you can't really run non-Linux operating systems inside the container. Virtual machines don't borrow a lot of resources from the host operating system, so they are slower and heavier, but also more flexible.
